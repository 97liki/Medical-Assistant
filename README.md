# Medical Assistant System

## Introduction
This project leverages advanced machine learning and information retrieval techniques to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms and recommends corresponding specialist doctors based on user ratings. This system is particularly useful for individuals with limited medical knowledge and can aid in early disease detection and diagnosis. It also offers a solution for those hesitant to visit hospitals for minor symptoms by providing preliminary insights into the potential severity of their condition.

## Overview
The system takes symptoms from users, predicts possible diseases, and then recommends corresponding specialist doctors based on the highest user satisfaction scores. It aims to simplify and improve the accuracy of self-diagnosis processes and streamline the process of finding the right medical professional.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of disease and symptom data scraped from the internet:
- **Diseases and Symptoms:** Data was initially scraped from the National Health Portal of India and further enriched by extracting information from various Wikipedia pages.
- **Doctor Profiles:** Doctor data, including specialties and ratings, was sourced from a comprehensive dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umarzafar/pakistani-doctors-profiles-dataset), which details Pakistani doctors' profiles.

## Disease to Symptom Mapping
Mapping between diseases and symptoms was generated using advanced natural language processing techniques, including GPT-3.5, ensuring a high level of accuracy and relevance.

## System Workflow
- **Data Collection:** Collection of Data from various sources.
- **Symptom Input:** Users input their symptoms into the system.
- **Disease Prediction:** The system employs machine learning models to predict potential diseases based on the input symptoms.
- **Doctor Recommendation:** Based on the predicted diseases, the system recommends doctors specializing in the relevant medical fields, prioritizing those with the highest user satisfaction ratings.

## Running the System
To operate the system:
1. **Notebook Use:** Open the `Doctor_Recommendation.ipynb` in Google Colab (recommended) or any Jupyter environment.
2. **Execution:** Run all cells in the notebook. Users will be prompted to input their symptoms at required steps.
3. **Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the notebook, particularly the googlesearch library if running outside Google Colab to avoid potential issues.

## Results
The effectiveness of the system was validated by comparing its disease predictions with outputs from established medical databases like WebMDâ€™s Symptom Checker. Our models, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree, achieved an accuracy rate of up to 91.29%.
